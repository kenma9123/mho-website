</blockquote>
<p>Try not to do a bounty mission before hitting your exp cap if you're below 
15, you might have quests that asks you to do a bounty mission.</p>

<h3>Hunting Tickets</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>One ticket is used up every time you enter a hunting ground, 2 for HR grounds.</p>
  <p>You start off with 10, the maximum you can hold at a time is 30.</p>
  <p>You get 10 tickets daily at daily reset, which will not go over 30 if you have more than 20 tickets at the end of the day.</p>
  <p>You have 20 reserve tickets, which can be redeemed at anytime by clicking on the ticket icon in the UI.</p>
  <p>Reserve tickets are replenished every Thursday also at daily reset time.
  </p><p>You can go over the max of 30 tickets if you use a Ticket Token (white coin with a helm symbol).</p>
  <p>You can buy these ticket tokens at the female merchant with the white mask. (Up to 6)</p>
  <p>Also occasionally at the guild merchant when he stocks them. (2 per day)</p>
  <p>Story quests will take up most of your time on your journey to 40, and they replenish any ticket you use too.</p>
  <p>Some gift bags/presents give you ticket tokens as well.</p>
